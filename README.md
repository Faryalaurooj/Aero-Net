# Fighter-Net
This repo introduces Fighter-Net model architecture with convolutional layers integrated with transformer encoders to capture both local and global contextual information, Multi-scale attention module is used to process features of objects at multiple scales and feature fusion module concatenates multi-scale features and a cascading network for precise classification. We will use this framework to perform aircraft type recognition from remote sensing images which is a difficuilt task.
